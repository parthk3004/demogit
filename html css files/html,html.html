<h3>
 3D ANIMATION
 </h3>
 <p>         At Born Artist, our skilled animators begin the 3D animation process by using polygons to create figures. Digital armatures are then used to bring the figures to life. We can breathe life into 3D characters and images for your movie, game, product demos, website, television program or presentation. Our animators are adept at various types of 3D animation, such as skeletal animation, motion capture, crowd simulation, cel-shaded animation, and morph target animation.
</p><h3>
2) 2D ANIMATION
</h3><p>      Our expert animators create 2D characters or images by using computer adaptations of traditional animation techniques. Bitmap graphics or 2D vector graphics are first created and then animated. To bring out the best in 2D characters or images, we use techniques such as morphing, onion-skinning, tweening, and interpolated rotoscoping. We have extensive experience in providing 2D animation services for movies, e-Learning courses, product demos, games, corporate presentations, website banners, animated logos, and simulations.
</p><h3>
3) MOTION GRAPHICS
     </h3><p> We turn your idea into a short animation using engaging motion graphics which keep your audience interested in the story. our animation and motion graphics artists create visually stunning pieces for a broad range of applications including TV commercials, promotional web videos, internal communications, event graphics, video game cinematics, logo animations, music videos and broadcast graphics..
</p><h3>
4) GRAPHIC DESIGN 
	</h3><p>
	Well executed design and animation has a huge impact on the look and feel of any project. Increasingly so, it is the project. No matter if it’s a commercial or a documentary, a web-video or a conference presentation, we bring the same design skill and meticulous attention to detail to any 2D, 3D, and graphic animation project. Our motion graphic services blend technical skill with artistic flair to create 2D or 3D computer-generated or hand-drawn animations. Depending on the scope of your project we can create something as simple as a basic caption all the way to fully animated elements, elevating the visual impact of your content.
